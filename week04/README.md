# Week 04 ‚Äì Duotone Noise Texture

This sketch uses Perlin noise to create a smoothly varying texture and maps grayscale noise values to a custom duotone gradient using `lerpColor()`.

## üìù Design Notes

This sketch helped me understand:

- How to use `noise()` to generate organic patterns.
- The technique of mapping grayscale to a custom color gradient.
- Leveraging `lerpColor()` to implement duotone effects.

### Challenges

- Mapping noise output to color ranges cleanly.
- Understanding how `frameCount` and noise evolve over time.
- Balancing the two colors so the gradient felt smooth and expressive.
