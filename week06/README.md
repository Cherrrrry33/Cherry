# Week-06 Task

This sketch combines visual(from week4) generation with sci-fi movie style audio. It layers low, mid, and high-frequency audio using different oscillators, each filtered separately.

## Requirements

- **Processing version**: 4.3  
- **Library**: `processing.sound`

---

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the `processing.sound` library installed.
2. Rum `week6.pde` in Processing.

## Design Notes

This sketch helped me explore:

- Creating layered audio using oscillators and noise.
- Applying low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters.
- Synchronizing visual noise patterns with audio animation.

### Challenges

- Understanding how audio filters affect oscillators in real time.
- Tuning parameters to create a pleasant balance between sound and visuals.
