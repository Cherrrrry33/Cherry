## Design Notes

This sketch helped me explore:

- Creating layered audio using oscillators and noise.
- Applying low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters.
- Synchronizing visual noise patterns with audio animation.

### Challenges

- Understanding how audio filters affect oscillators in real time.
- Tuning parameters to create a pleasant balance between sound and visuals.
