# Week-01 Task

This week’s focus was on learning how to manipulate pixels directly in Processing to create color gradients. Below are three gradient sketches that explore color transitions in different directions and patterns.

---

## Requirements

- **Processing version**: 4.3  
- **Libraries**: None required

---

## How to Run

Each sketch is written in its own `.pde` file. Open and run them in Processing.

- `week1_1.pde` – Add color
- `week1_2.pde` – Change direction
- `week1_3.pde` – Circular gradient based on distance from center
