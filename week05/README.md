# Week 05 â€“ Duotone Camera Dithering

This sketch captures live video from the webcam, applies a dithering effect by thresholding and diffusing brightness errors, and remaps the output to a custom duotone gradient. It combines real-time image processing with generative color output.

## Requirements

- **Processing version**: 4.3  
- **Library**: `processing.video`  
- **Hardware**: A working webcam

## How to Run

1. Make sure your webcam is connected.
2. Ensure the `processing.video` library is installed.
3. Run `Week-05-Task.pde` in Processing.

## Design Notes

This sketch helped me explore:

- Capturing and reading live webcam video frames.
- Mapping grayscale output to a duotone gradient in real time.

### Challenges

- Getting the webcam feed to initialize properly across devices.
- Managing pixel-level operations while keeping real-time performance.
