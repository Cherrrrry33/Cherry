## Design Notes

This sketch helped me understand how to:

- Load and analyze image pixel data.
- Break down RGB values from each pixel.

### Challenges

- Scaling the histogram correctly so that it fits within the canvas.
- Remembering to normalize or map histogram values to consistent visual heights.
